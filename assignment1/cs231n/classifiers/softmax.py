  """
  Softmax loss function, naive implementation (with loops)
  Inputs have dimension D, there are C classes, and we operate on minibatches
  of N examples.
  Inputs:
  - W: A numpy array of shape (D, C) containing weights.
  - X: A numpy array of shape (N, D) containing a minibatch of data.
  - y: A numpy array of shape (N,) containing training labels; y[i] = c means
    that X[i] has label c, where 0 <= c < C.
  - reg: (float) regularization strength
  Returns a tuple of:
  - loss as single float
  - gradient with respect to weights W; an array of same shape as W
